Question: 
Is Jesus son of Mary alive or dead? What is the evidence from the Quran or Sunnah? If he is alive or dead, then where is he now? And what is the evidence for that from the Quran and Sunnah? 

Answer: 
Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him) is alive; he has not died up till now. The Jews did not kill him or crucify him; rather it was caused to appear that way to them. Allah took him up to heaven, body and soul, and until now he is in heaven. The evidence for that is the words of Allah, may He be exalted, concerning the fabrication of the Jews and the refutation thereof: “And because of their saying (in boast), "We killed the Messiah Jesus , son of Mary, the messenger of Allah," - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not (i.e. Jesus, son of Mary). But Allah raised him (Jesus ) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise” [Al-Nisa :157-158]. Thus Allah, may He be glorified, declared false the words of the Jews when they claimed that they had killed him and crucified him, and He stated that He took him up to Him. That was mercy from Him to him, and was an honour to him, so that he would be one of his signs, an honour that He bestows upon whomever He wills of His messengers. How many signs of Allah there are in the story of Jesus son of Mary (peace be upon him), from beginning to end. The implication of the words “But Allah raised him (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself” is that Allah, may He be glorified, took Jesus (peace be upon him) up body and soul, so as to refute the claim of the Jews that they crucified him and killed him, because killing and crucifying have to do with the physical body. Moreover, if He had only taken up his soul, that would not rule out the claim of having killed and crucified him, because taking up the soul only would not be a refutation of their claim. Also the name of Jesus (peace be upon him), in reality, refers to him in both soul and body together; it cannot refer to one of them only, unless there is an indication to that effect. Furthermore, taking up both his soul and his body together is indicative of the perfect might and wisdom of Allah, and of His honour and support to whomever He wills among His Messengers, according to what He, may He be exalted, says at the end of the verse: “And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”
